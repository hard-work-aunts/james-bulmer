# Fast Food Map

The goal of this repo will be to hopefully produce a map that shows the correlation (if any) between the number of fast food outlets and BMI in America, this will be a quick and dirty project just to visualize the data available. Feel free to jump in and make any suggestions and/or comments to improve its function and usefulness. Note that you can check my progress through http://fastfood.jabulmer12.com/

## Todo

* Check that the raw data matches the expected structure
* Create a basic Google map (or openmap) with relevant jquery plugins
* Display all stores on the map and check for errors
* Display population data on the map and check for errors
* Create a better method to view the data (county colouring, search functions ,ect)
* Spell check every thing
